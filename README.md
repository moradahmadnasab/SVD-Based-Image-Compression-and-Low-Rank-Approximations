## ðŸ”Ž Overview
Low-rank approximation of images using SVD is a powerful technique in **image compression**, **denoising**, and **dimensionality reduction**.  
For a given image matrix \(A\), a **rank-\(k\) approximation** \(A_k\) is constructed as:

\[
A_k = \sum_{i=1}^k \sigma_i u_i v_i^T
\]

where \(\sigma_i\) are the singular values, and \(u_i, v_i\) are the corresponding left and right singular vectors.  
This approach allows **efficient storage** while maintaining visual quality.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- Automatic SVD-based **compression for both grayscale and color images**.  
- Calculates **Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)** and **Compression Ratio (CR)** for each rank \(k\).  
- Outputs **compressed images** and a **LaTeX metrics table** for direct inclusion in reports.  
- Fully reproducible using **Python 3.x** and open-source libraries: `numpy`, `scikit-image`, `matplotlib`.
